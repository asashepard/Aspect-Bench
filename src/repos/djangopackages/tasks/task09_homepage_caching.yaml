name: "Homepage data caching"
description: |
  ## Background
  The homepage view loads featured packages, grids, and stats on every request.
  This causes unnecessary database queries for data that changes infrequently.
  
  ## Problem
  Looking at `homepage/views.py`, the view queries multiple models without
  caching. This impacts homepage load times.
  
  ## Task
  1. Add caching to homepage featured packages (5 minute cache)
  2. Add caching to header grids (5 minute cache)
  3. Add caching to homepage stats (total packages, grids, users)
  4. Provide cache invalidation when relevant data changes
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Homepage queries are reduced on repeated loads
  - Cache keys are namespaced properly
  - Cache is invalidated when packages/grids are added
  - TTL is configurable via settings
  - Works with any cache backend (not just memcached)

baseline_prompt_hint: |
  Add caching to homepage views using Django's cache framework.
  Implement cache invalidation on model saves.

aspect_prompt_hint: |
  Review homepage/views.py and the Django cache documentation.
  Consider using cache decorators or low-level cache API.
