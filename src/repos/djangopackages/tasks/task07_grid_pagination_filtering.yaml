name: "Grid list pagination and filtering"
description: |
  ## Background
  The grid list API should support pagination and basic filtering.
  
  ## Problem
  The GridViewSet needs pagination and ability to filter by header status.
  
  ## Task
  1. Add pagination matching the package endpoint pattern
  2. Add filtering by `is_locked` and `header` boolean fields
  3. Support `?header=true` to show only header grids
  4. Support `?is_locked=false` to show only unlocked grids
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - Pagination works with count, next, previous, results
  - ?header=true filters to header grids only
  - ?is_locked=true/false filters correctly
  - Filters can be combined
  - Invalid filter values are handled gracefully
